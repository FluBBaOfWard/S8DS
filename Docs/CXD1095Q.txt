I/O hardware
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two Sony CXD1095Q I/O chips are used. Each has the following capabilities:

- Five I/O ports; A through D are 8 bits and E is 4 bits.
- Pin direction can be set for bit groups 7-4 or 3-0 for ports A through D.
- Pin direction can be set for bits 3-0 individually for port E.
- Output-disable pin to force input mode for ports A through D.

Each port consists of an output latch which is loaded when the port
is written to, and an input buffer. When in output mode, reading a port
returns the latch contents. When in input mode, the latch does nothing
(though it can still be written to) and reading a port returns the input
buffer data.

Commonly used addresses are:

$140000-$14000F : I/O chip #1
$150000-$15000F : I/O chip #2
$160000         : I/O chip output control

Each chip has eight internal registers:

$0001 - Port A data (r/w)
$0003 - Port B data (r/w)
$0005 - Port C data (r/w)
$0007 - Port D data (r/w)
$0009 - Port E data (r/w)
$000B - Unused
$000D - REG1 (w/o)
$000F - REG2 (w/o)

The upper 4 bits of port E, the unused register, and REG1, REG2 return zero
when read.

REG1 has the following layout:

Bit 7 : Port D bits 7-4 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 6 : Port D bits 3-0 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 5 : Port C bits 7-4 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 4 : Port C bits 3-0 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 3 : Port B bits 7-4 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 2 : Port B bits 3-0 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 1 : Port A bits 7-4 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 0 : Port A bits 3-0 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)

REG2 has the following layout:

Bit 7 : Unused
Bit 6 : Unused
Bit 5 : Unused
Bit 4 : Unused
Bit 3 : Bit 3 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 2 : Bit 2 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 1 : Bit 1 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)
Bit 0 : Bit 0 pin direction (0= output, 1= input)

For the X-Board hardware these should be initialized to $03 and $FF,
respectively.

Default states

When the ports are inputs (by /ODEN==L or REG1=$FF), their values
(as read by the CPU) are:

$140001 = $00
$140003 = $00
$140005 = $00
$140007 = $00
$140009 = $00

$150001 = $FF
$150003 = $FF
$150005 = $FF
$150007 = $FF
$150009 = $00

Output disable control

Each I/O chip has an input called /ODEN. When pulled low, ports A through D
become inputs in all eight bits.

Writing to ports A-D will update the internal latch, but the pin state
is unchanged. Reading ports A-D will return their input data, just as
if REG1 = $FF (though REG1 hasn't changed).

Accessing any location within $160000-$16FFFF latches bit 0 of the data
bus and outputs it to the /ODEN pin of both I/O chips. When /ODEN is low,
all pins of ports A through D become inputs. When /ODEN is high, the ports
are programmable through REG2.

Port E is unaffected by /ODEN, and none of the internal registers are
modified while /ODEN is low; furthermore changes to registers are
accepted though direction changes are not noticable until /ODEN is high.
