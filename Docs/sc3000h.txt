 1.) Introduction
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SC-3000H is a personal computer made by SEGA. For information about
 SEGA's 8-bit computers and game systems that came before the Mark III,
 check out the documentation for MEKA:

 http://www.smspower.org/meka/

 To briefly sum things up, here's a list of the different systems:

 SG-1000        No keyboard
 SG-1000 II     No keyboard, but supports the SK-1100 external keyboard
 SC-3000        Built-in keyboard with soft rubber keys
 SC-3000H       Built-in keyboard with hard plastic keys

 Expansion hardware

 An addition for the SC-3000 was the SF-7000, which adds 64K of RAM, 8K
 of ROM (for a disk operating system), Centronics parallel port, and an
 RS-232C serial port. Marc Le Dourain has a webpage about it at:

 3.) Connector pin assignments
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DC power jack (2.1mm)

 Tip is negative (ground), ring is positive (+9V DC).
 An AC adapter that can provide 850mA or more will work fine.

 Joystick connectors

   1 2 3 4 5
    6 7 8 9

 1 : Joystick up switch
 2 : Joystick down switch
 3 : Joystick left switch
 4 : Joystick right switch
 5 : Unused (not connected to anything)
 6 : Left trigger switch
 7 : Unused (not connected to anything)
 8 : Common
 9 : Right trigger switch

 Pin 8 is the common side of all switches in the joystick and is connected
 to output line 7 of the 74LS145. It is LOW when the seventh keyboard row
 is selected (enabling the joystick ports for input) and HIGH otherwise
 (joystick ports disabled).

 This is different from the SMS and Genesis/MegaDrive joystick connector
 which use pin 8 as ground and pin 5 as +5V. The original type of Master
 System joysticks are compatible with the SC-3000H, but I would not advise
 using any special SMS joysticks (e.g. autofire or programmable) or any
 Genesis/MegaDrive joysticks with the SC-3000H.

 Pins 1-7 of CN7 are outputs to select rows in the keyboard's key matrix.

 Pins 8-11 of CN7 and 1-8 of CN8 are inputs with pull-up resistors to read
 data from the selected keyboard row.

 Pin 10 is not used by the keyboard. It is connected to the power switch
 and could have been intended to control the power LED, which instead has
 its own direct connection to the switch.

 Pin 11 of CN8 is an output to the NMI-IN pin of the MITEC-2 chip.

 Cartridge connector

 The cartridge connector has 22 pins on both sides, on .125" (3.175mm)
 centers.

 Work RAM enable

 The work RAM /CS signal from the MITEC-2 chip goes through series
 resistor R3 (1K ohm) to the /CE pin of the 2Kx8 work RAM as well
 as pin B3 of the cartridge connector. This allows pin B3 to enable or
 disable work RAM as follows:

 If pin B3 is tied to +5V, the work RAM is disabled and the cartridge can
 freely map memory to the C000-FFFF range. This does not conflict with
 the work RAM /CS signal as it is effectively connected to a 1K pull-up
 resistor to +5V. If pin B3 is left unconnected, the work RAM /CE input is driven by the
 MITEC work RAM /CS output and work RAM functions normally.

 Grounding pin 3 would force work RAM to be permanently enabled and would
 cause a bus conflict, preventing the system from operating. Some BASIC
 cartridges appear to have circuitry to dynamically control this pin,
 allowing work RAM to be selectively enabled within parts of the C000-FFFF
 range. This may allow the cartridge to map RAM within that region that
 supplements the built-in work RAM instead of replacing it.

 Other strobes

 Pin B4 is a chip select signal for memory accesses to the $8000-$BFFF range.
 Pins B5 and B6 are /MREQ and /RD,/WR combined for memory read/write strobes.
 Pins B7 and B8 are /IORQ and /RD,/WR combined for I/O read/write strobes.

 Pin B11 is connected to PPI PB4 through a pull-up resistor. The SF-7000
 documentation labels this pin /CONT, though it's just another input bit.

 Pins B12 to B17 are used for controlling DRAM, managed by the MITEC-2 chip.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3.) Memory map and cartridge types
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The memory map is mostly defined by the cartridge. As mentioned earlier
 the MITEC-2 chip does provide a /CS signal for the $8000-$BFFF and
 $C000-$FFFF range, but it's up to the cartridge how to map ROM, RAM, etc.
 to memory.

 For any memory area that is unused, such as the work RAM area when it is
 disabled, reads return the high byte of the address bus (e.g. reading $C1AB
 would return $C1).

 I only have a Safari Hunting and Basic Level III A cartridge, so some of the
 following information may not apply to other cartridge types.

 Safari Hunting

 This cartridge has two sockets, one for a 16K ROM and another for a 2K RAM.
 The Safari Hunting game only uses the ROM and leaves the RAM socket empty.
 Here are the pin assignments:

 16K ROM (28-pin DIP)

        +---\/---+
    VCC |01    28| VCC
    A12 |02    27| VCC
     A7 |03    26| A13
     A6 |04    25| A8
     A5 |05    24| A9
     A4 |06    23| A11
     A3 |07    22| /OE  (From Z80 A15)
     A2 |08    21| A10
     A1 |09    20| /CS  (from Z80 /MREQ)
     A0 |10    19| D7
     D0 |11    18| D6
     D1 |12    17| D5
     D2 |13    16| D4
    GND |14    15| D3
        +--------+

 2Kx8 SRAM (24-pin DIP)

        +---\/---+
     A7 |01    24| VCC
     A6 |02    23| A8
     A5 |03    22| A9
     A4 |04    21| /WR (From pin B6, memory /WR)
     A3 |05    20| /OE (From pin B5, memory /RD)
     A2 |06    19| A10
     A1 |07    18| /CS (From pin B4, $8000-$BFFF /EXM1)
     A0 |08    17| D7
     D0 |09    16| D6
     D1 |10    15| D5
     D2 |11    14| D4
    GND |12    13| D3
        +--------+

 This gives the following memory map:

 $0000-$3FFF : ROM
 $4000-$7FFF : ROM (mirror)
 $8000-$BFFF : RAM (mirrored repeatedly every 2K)
 $C000-$FFFF : Work RAM (mirrored repeatedly every 2K)

 Basic Level III A (PAL)

 This cartridge has a 32K ROM and four 16Kx4 DRAM sockets. Two of them
 have TMS4416 16Kx4 DRAMs, the other two are empty. This would allow up to
 32K total, but only 16K is present.

 32K ROM (28-pin DIP)

        +--------+
    VCC |01    28| VCC
    A12 |02    27| A14
     A7 |03    26| A13
     A6 |04    25| A8
     A5 |05    24| A9
     A4 |06    23| A11
     A3 |07    22| /OE  (From pin B5, memory /RD)
     A2 |08    21| A10
     A1 |09    20| /CS  (From 74LS32)
     A0 |10    19| D7
     D0 |11    18| D6
     D1 |12    17| D5
     D2 |13    16| D4
    GND |14    15| D3
        +--------+

 One gate of the 74LS32 is used to enable the ROM only during memory reads
 when Z80 A15 is low, giving the following memory map:

 $0000-$7FFF : ROM
 $8000-$BFFF : DRAM (first 16K)
 $C000-$FFFF : Work RAM (mirrored repeatedly every 2K)
 - or - 
 $C000-$FFFF : DRAM (latter 16K if work RAM disabled and missing DRAM chips added)

 Cartridge information from other sources:

 Terebi Oekaki

 $0000-$1FFF : ROM
 $6000       : Graphics tablet axis to read
 $8000       : Pen pressure sense / axis data conversion busy flag
 $A000       : Axis data

 This cartridge connects to a pressure sensitive graphics tablet.
 A plastic stylus is used, which can have its position tracked when
 pressed against the tablet.

 SF-7000

 $0000-$3FFF : ROM (8K, presumably mirrored twice)
 $0000-$FFFF : RAM (as 48K from $4000 or 64K from $0000)

 On power-up, the first 16K is for ROM and the remaining 48K is for RAM.
 The ROM can be switched out through the SF-7000's PPI, allowing all of
 the RAM to be used.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4.) Z80 port map
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The VDP, PSG, and PPI are enabled according to the following port
 addresses:

 Range     PPI     VDP     PSG      Data returned
 ------    ---     ---     ---      ---------------------------
 $00-1F     Y       Y       Y       PPI+VDP
 $20-3F     N       Y       Y       VDP
 $40-5F     Y       N       Y       PPI
 $60-7F     N       N       Y       Instruction referenced by R
 $80-9F     Y       Y       N       PPI+VDP
 $A0-BF     N       Y       N       VDP
 $C0-DF     Y       N       N       PPI
 $E0-FF     N       N       N       Instruction referenced by R

 $E0-E1                             SF-7000, FDC (765AC).
 $E4-E7                             SF-7000, PPI (8255A).
 $E8-E9                             SF-7000, USART (8251).

 For each location, data written goes to all devices that are enabled.

 For addresses where both the PPI and VDP are enabled (regardless of the
 PSG) the data returned is from the PPI but has a few bits corrupted,
 most likely due to the VDP trying to place information on the data bus at
 the same time.

 The officially documented ports for each device are the ones where only
 one of them is enabled. The PSG has no readable registers, so even when
 it's enabled, there is no change to the data returned.

 The SF-7000 maps its own hardware at ports $E0-FF. I haven't looked
 into SF-7000 emulation much, so I can't comment on how these ports are
 used.

 Memory refresh behavior

 The Z80 has a function for providing DRAM refresh. During any opcode fetch
 cycle (either a prefix byte or the opcode itself) the following events
 occur during states T3 and T4:

 - /RFSH goes low
 - /M1 goes high
 - A15-A8 output I register contents
 - A7-A0 output R register contents
 - /MREQ goes low for the latter half of the T3 cycle and the first half of
   the T4 cycle

 So it looks like a regular memory access from the address indicated by
 the IR register pair, except /RFSH is used instead of /RD.

 Typically, most SC-3000 cartridges are designed where ROM /OE = /MREQ and
 ROM /CS = A15. In this case they will respond to a refresh cycle within
 addresses $0000-$7FFF and output data to the bus.

 This behavior manifests itself when reading I/O ports $60-$7F and $E0-$FF.
 No device will drive the data bus when these ports are read, so the value
 returned is the byte read during the refresh cycle. Here is an step-by-step
 description of what occurs:

 Assume ROM data at offset $2A00 is $AB, $CD, $EF
 Sample program is:

    xor a
    ld  b, a
    ld  c, $E0
    ld  a, $2A
    ld  i, a
    ld  a, $01
    ld  r, a    ; Set refresh address in IR pair. ($2A01)
    in  a, (c)  ; Read from port in BC pair. ($00E0)

 We are interested in the timing for the 'in a, (c)' instruction. In this
 case, it has three machine cycles of four T states each. The opcode for
 the encoding of this particular instruction is $ED, $78.

 [Opcode fetch cycle]
 T1 : Address bus outputs PC
 T2 : Read opcode $ED
 T3 : Refresh cycle start (IR = $2A01, read $CD)
 T4 : Refresh cycle end

 [Opcode fetch cycle]
 T1 : Address bus outputs PC
 T2 : Read opcode $78
 T3 : Refresh cycle start (IR = $2A02, read $EF)
 T4 : Refresh cycle end

 [I/O cycle]
 T1 : Address bus outputs BC ($00E0)
 T2 : /IORQ and /RD go low
 TW : Forced wait cycle (lengthened if /WAIT low)
 T3 : Data bus sampled, /IORQ and /WR go high

 In this example, we assume there is ROM that will respond to the memory
 access for the reasons listed earlier. (ROM /OE = /MREQ, ROM /CS = A15)
 The value read back from the IN instruction is $EF, that was left over
 from the previous refresh cycle.

 If there was no device to drive the data bus, the last value on the data
 bus is $78, and that is the value that is returned during the IN instruction
 read.

 An exception is the Basic Level III A cartridge; its ROM is disabled during
 a refresh cycle, but the lower 3 bits of the data bus seem to fluctuate,
 so you get values like $7B, $7F, instead of $78. Maybe all of the additional
 hardware in the cartridge that is connected to the data bus affects the
 bus capacitance somewhat, so it doesn't 'hold' the previous value as well
 from the T2 state of the 2nd machine cycle all the way to T3 of the 3rd
 machine cycle.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 5.) Keyboard and I/O
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The keyboard, gamepads, and cassette/printer interface are handled through
 an 8255 PPI. This chip has 24 I/O pins which are arranged into 3
 8-bit I/O ports called A, B, and C. It also has a control register which
 defines if the ports are outputs or inputs, amongst other things.

 The PPI has the /RESET input disabled. This means the PPI will be in an
 undefined state when power is applied and no assumptions can be made
 about how it is configured after a cold boot.

 Port A (input) $DC

 D7 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D6 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D5 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D4 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D3 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D2 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D1 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D0 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.

 Pins PA7-PA0 have a 4.7K ohm pull-up resistor and are active low inputs.

 Port B (input) $DD

 D7 : From "HIC-1" pin 7 (Cassette data input).
 D6 : BUSY input from serial printer.
 D5 : FAULT input from serial printer.
 D4 : /CONT input from B11 on cartridge connector.
 D3 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D2 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D1 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.
 D0 : Keyboard/gamepad input data.

 Pins PB6-PB0 have a 4.7K ohm pull-up resistor and are active-low inputs.
 PB7 is an active-high input.

 With no external devices attached, bits 7,6,5 return 0,1,1 respectively.

 Port C (output) $DE

 D7 : To printer port pin 3 (/FEED output to serial printer)
 D6 : To printer port pin 5 (/RESET output to serial printer output) 
 D5 : To printer port pin 2 (DATA output to serial printer output)   
 D4 : To "HIC-1" pin 10 (Cassette data output)
 D3 : Unused (not connected to anything)
 D2 : To 74LS145 to select 1 of 8 keyboard rows (bit 2)
 D1 : To 74LS145 to select 1 of 8 keyboard rows (bit 1)
 D0 : To 74LS145 to select 1 of 8 keyboard rows (bit 0)

 Mode 2 = Bi-Directional Bus

 Bank Panic, Bomb Jack, Border Line writes $92 here.
 Sega Basic Level 2 writes $92, $0C, $0F, $0A, $0D.... $92 here.
 Most software writes $92 to the PPI control register and $07 to PPI port C,
 which configures ports A and B as inputs and all bits of port C as outputs,
 as well as selecting row 7 of the keyboard matrix to access the gamepads.

 When port C is configured as an output, reading it returns the last value
 written to port C. The PPI control register cannot be read, and always
 returns $FF.

 The descriptions of the PPI ports were taken from Marc Le Dourain's
 SF-7000 page, which I believe were in turn taken from a SF-7000 manual.
 So I can't really elaborate much more on what each bit does, beyond what
 I've checked myself.

 The SC-3000H has a 64-key keyboard, and two gamepad ports. One of the keys
 is called "RESET" and generates a NMI on the Z80 when pressed.

 Bits 7-0 of port A and 3-0 of port B are used to return data from the
 keyboard and gamepads. This data is broken down into 8 groups, with seven
 for the keyboard rows and one for the two gamepads.

 The keyboard rows are assigned to the following keys, where each bit
 returns one for a pressed key and zero if the key has not been pressed.

 The keys are arranged in an 8x12 matrix as shown above. Some combinations
 of key presses will cause other keys to appear to be pressed.
 There are two rules which define this behavior:

 If two or more keys on any keyboard row are pressed, pressing any key
 on another row that occupies the same columns will cause all other keys
 in the same columns to appear to be pressed.

 For example, if keys 1, Q, A, Z are pressed, pressing 2 will also make
 keys W, S, and X appear to be pressed.

 If two or more keys on any keyboard column are pressed, pressing any key
 on another column that occupies the same rows will cause all other keys
 in the same rows to appear to be pressed.

 For example, if keys 1, 2, 3, 4 are pressed, pressing Q will also make
 keys W, E, and R appear to be pressed.

 The two joystick ports are affected by this behavior too.

 Most software writes $92 to the PPI control register and $07 to PPI port C,
 which configures ports A and B as inputs and all bits of port C as outputs,
 as well as selecting row 7 of the keyboard matrix to access the gamepads.

 When port C is configured as an output, reading it returns the last value
 written to port C. The PPI control register cannot be read, and always
 returns $FF.

 6.) TMS9929A information
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - When writing to a VDP register, bits 6-3 of the byte written are
   ignored by the VDP.

 - Data written to the data port is also copied to the VRAM read buffer.

 - Bits 7-3 of register #0 and bit 2 of register #1 have no use.

 - Bit 0 of register #0 does not turn off the screen when set, but rather
   distorts the synchronization of the display. This bit is intended to
   enable external video input which is unused in the SC-3000H.

 - Bit 7 of register #1 affects how the VDP generates addresses when
   accessing VRAM. Here's a table illustrating the differences:

   VDP address      VRAM address
   (Column)         4K mode     8/16K mode
   AD0              VA0         VA0
   AD1              VA1         VA1
   AD2              VA2         VA2
   AD3              VA3         VA3
   AD4              VA4         VA4
   AD5              VA5         VA5
   AD6              VA12        VA6
   AD7              Not used    Not used
   (Row)
   AD0              VA6         VA7
   AD1              VA7         VA8
   AD2              VA8         VA9
   AD3              VA9         VA10
   AD4              VA10        VA11
   AD5              VA11        VA12
   AD6              VA13        VA13
   AD7              Not used    Not used

   ADx - TMS9928 8-bit VRAM address/data bus
   VAx - 14-bit VRAM address that the VDP wants to access

   How the address is formed has to do with the physical layout of memory
   cells in a DRAM chip. A 4Kx1 chip has 64x64 cells, a 8Kx1 or 16Kx1 chip
   has 128x64 or 128x128 cells. Because the DRAM address bus is multiplexed,
   this means 6 bits are used for 4K DRAMs and 7 bits are used for 8K or 16K
   DRAMs.

   In 4K mode the 6 bits of the row and column are output first, with
   the remaining high-order bits mapped to AD6. In 8/16K mode the 7 bits
   of the row and column are output normally. This also means that even
   in 4K mode, all 16K of VRAM can be accessed. The only difference is in
   what addresses are used to store data.

 7.) Custom components
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 "HIC-1" (11-pin SIP)

  1 : +5V
  2 : Unused (not connected to anything).
  3 : Active-low RESET output to TMS9929, Z80, etc.
  4 : Unused (not connected to anything).
  5 : Unused (not connected to anything).
  6 : Unused (not connected to anything).
  7 : Output to PPI PB7 (Tape data in)
  8 : Ground
  9 : To CASSETTE-OUT miniplug jack.
 10 : Input from PPI PC3 (Tape data out).
 11 : From CASSETTE-IN miniplug jack.

 This part provides an interface between the PPI's digital I/O pins
 and the line-level audio signals going to and from a cassette deck.

 Pin 3 is conditioned by some external hardware to become an open collector
 output with a 10K pull-up to +5V via R21. It drives the reset inputs of
 the Z80 and TMS9929A.

 NMI-IN is from the keyboard RESET key. I don't know if it's active high
 or low. The chip debounces this input to provide a glitch-free pulse
 to the Z80 NMI pin.

 The memory /RD, /WR strobes are used by the 2Kx8 work RAM and cartridge
 connector.

 The I/O port /RD, /WR strobes are used by the 8255 PPI and cartridge
 connector.

 The TMS9929A has no chip select input, so it has its own read/write
 strobes.

 The SN76489A /WE and /READY pins are tied together to Z80 /WAIT. The MITEC-2
 enables the PSG (via /CE) when the Z80 has written to the PSG port and is
 driving the data bus; then the PSG /READY signal will delay the Z80 while
 the PSG is processing the data being input from the bus.

 This forces a wait state depending on how long the SN76489 asserts /READY,
 which is for 32 cycles following a write. See the SN76489 datasheet for
 more information.

 DRAM interface

 The MITEC-2 chip provides several output signals for managing DRAM:

 MITEC    Cartridge   Signal    Description
 pin      pin         name

 19       B14         RA7       DRAM row, bit 7
 20       B17         /RCSEL    Row/column select (1= row, 0= column)
 21       B12         /RAS0     Row address strobe for DRAM
 22       B15         /RAS1     Row address strobe for DRAM
 23       B13         /CAS0     Column address strobe for DRAM
 24       B16         /CAS1     Column address strobe for DRAM

 The Z80 has a 7-bit refresh counter which allows it to refresh DRAMs with
 128 rows maximum. To support 256 rows, the MITEC chip monitors the state
 of A6 during a refresh cycle to determine when a carry out from bit 6 of
 the refresh counter should toggle RA7. This makes RA7 function as the eighth
 bit of the Z80's internal refresh counter.

 Unlike the other Z80 address pins, RA7 does not function as A7 outside
 of refresh cycles, so it has a dedicated pin on the cartridge connector.
 The cartridge is responsible for routing RA7 instead of A7 to the DRAMs.

 An approximation of the logic equations for the MITEC-2 outputs are as
 follows:

 MEMORY WR#    = !MREQ & !WR;
 MEMORY RD#    = !MREQ & !RD;

 I/O PORT WR#  = !IORQ & !WR;
 I/O PORT RD#  = !IORQ & !RD;

 TMS9929A /CSW = !IORQ &  A7 & !A6 & !WR;
 TMS9929A /CSR = !IORQ &  A7 & !A6 & !RD;
 SN76489A /CE  = !IORQ & !A7 &  A6 & !WR;

 /EXM1         = !A15 & !A14;
 Work RAM /CS  =  A15 &  A14;

 * Note that /EXM1 and Work RAM /CS are not qualified with /MREQ, so they
   can even be triggered when accessing I/O ports when all 16 bits of the
   port address are within $8000-$FFFF, or by refresh pulses if the I
   register is set up such that refreshes are made from $8000-$FFFF.

   This does not cause a conflict as the only read and write strobes
   available on the cartridge connector are qualified with MREQ#.

 !RCSEL_INT    = !MREQ & !RFSH & (!RD # !WR);
 RCSEL         = Delay(RCSEL_INT, 64ns);

 !RAS0         = !MREQ & !RFSH
               # !MREQ &  RFSH & A:[8000..BFFF];
 !RAS1         = !MREQ & !RFSH
               # !MREQ &  RFSH & A:[C000..FFFF];

 !CAS0_INT     = RCSEL & A:[8000..BFFF];
 !CAS1_INT     = RCSEL & A:[C000..FFFF];

 CAS0          = Delay(CAS0_INT, 64ns);
 CAS1          = Delay(CAS1_INT, 64ns);

 DRAM timing description

 RAS0,1 are asserted for refresh cycles and memory accesses to their
 respective address ranges. They follow MREQ and cause the row address
 to be latched.

 /RCSEL_INT follows /RD or /WR when during a memory cycle (/MREQ asserted,
 /RFSH negated) regardless of the address. This signal goes through a 64ns
 delay line and is output as /RCSEL. The delay gives time for RASx to fall
 and latch the row address before /RCSEL changes.

 CAS0_INT and CAS1_INT follow the delayed /RCSEL by a further 64ns. This
 gives time for the multiplexers to switch over from the row address to
 the column address before /CASn falls and latches them.

 Basic Level III A cartridge DRAM implementation

 The two TMS4416 DRAM chips mapped to $8000-$BFFF use /RAS0 and /CAS0.
 Their /CAS signal is RCSEL and /CAS0 logically-OR'd together.

 The two unused chips mapped to $C000-$FFFF use /RAS1 and /CAS1.
 Their /CAS signal is RCSEL and /CAS1 logically-OR'd together.

 RA7 is common to all four chips.

 Two multiplexers are used to break up the Z80 address bus into the row
 and column words, formatted as follows:

 TMS4416    Column (RCSEL=0)    Row (RCSEL=1)

 DRAM A0    GND                 Z80 A0
 DRAM A1    Z80 A8              Z80 A1   
 DRAM A2    Z80 A9              Z80 A2   
 DRAM A3    Z80 A10             Z80 A3 
 DRAM A4    Z80 A11             Z80 A4 
 DRAM A5    Z80 A12             Z80 A5 
 DRAM A6    Z80 A13             Z80 A6 
 DRAM A7    GND                 RA7

 Bits 0 and 7 of the row for 16Kx4 DRAMs are unused to allow expansion.
 64Kx4 DRAMs use these bits for address bits 14 and 15, respectively.

 RA7 is used for bit 7 of the DRAM row instead of Z80 A7.
 Z80 A7 is used by A7 of the 32K mask ROM only.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 8.) Miscellaneous
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In my experience a US SMS 2 power supply and standard Genesis / MegaDrive
 A/V cable (composite video + mono audio) will work with a SC-3000H.

 It seems that when an interrupt occurs, the value on the Z80's data bus
 is random data. It could be the same as reading unused ports, where the
 Z80's R register indexes ROM to select the value read. This is because
 there are no pull-up resistors on the Z80 data bus, and the value
 returned is influenced by stray capacitance in the data bus traces
 on the circuit board.

 This means that interrupt mode 0 and 2 cannot be used reliably. In the
 latter case it may be possible to set the I register to a location in RAM
 and fill up all 257 bytes from that point with the same byte, say $08,
 so the Z80 will jump to $0808 regardless of what data it read as the
 low byte for the vector table. I think a similar technique is used in
 some Spectrum computer software, though I have not tested this myself.

 The SN76489A is not reset when the SC-3000H is powered on. If you cycle the
 power to reset the machine, the PSG will play same sounds it was last
 programmed to make, and from a cold boot the PSG emits a medium volume tone.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 9.) Assistance Needed
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Is there any information about how the cassette and printer interfaces
   work? Does any software support either one (Basic maybe), or are
   there any cassette images available?

 - I'm looking for datasheets for the MCM4517P15, TMS4027, TMS4108, TMS4116,
   TMS4416, MB81416 DRAMs, as well as schematics for any hardware that uses
   a TMS9918 or related video chip with only 4K of video RAM.

 - I'd be interested in knowing what kind of hardware is inside a Terebi
   Oekeki or Rozetta no Shouzou cartridge (chip part numbers, etc.)

 - Could anyone tell me what parts are in a SF-7000? If it implements its
   main memory with two 64Kx4 DRAMs, would somebody be willing to trace out
   the connections to the cartridge port, for comparison with the way DRAMs
   are managed in the Basic Level III A cartridge?
